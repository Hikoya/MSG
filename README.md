 Monitoring of Miniature Smart Gauge 

In recent months, the school has designed and manufactured miniature smart gauges that communicates wirelessly via Zigbee to send the readings of electrical data, such as voltage, current, power, energy and frequency. The smart gauge can handle both AC and DC power to continuously monitor the rate of energy consumption for analysis as well as monitoring.

However, since the gauge can only transmit within such a short range due to the limitations of the Zigbee protocol, a more efficient way is required to monitor the sensor outputs in remote locations away from the gauge at all times. Hence, a dashboard is created for quick analysis of data as well as anomaly detection. Information is updated in real-time and additional machine learning can be added to the webserver at any time due to its versatility and that it is completely written in Python.

The project was handed over to a group of final-year students to be further improved on and implemented campus-wide.
